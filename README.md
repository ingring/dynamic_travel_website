# A dynamic travel website

## About the project
This page was created as a part of the subject IDG1292 Front-end development, a subject on the department of design on NTNU Gj√∏vik. 

## The task
Give the user a random place to travel to in Europe as well as presenting a picture and inform about the place. The user can also decide if it wants a city with a beach, a capital or other cities. Then the user can custom their own bucket list with adding and deleting cities from the list. 

## The process 
This task was seperated in three assignments. I started defining the goal and designed the script, first with bulletspoints and then with flowchart.

## Notes
The focus point on this project was making a website with JavaScript, I have unprioritezed styling. Therefore, this website is not responsive, it is best to see this project on a desktop. 

### Comments on assignment 3
I tried to follow the dry principle, don't repeat yourself, as best I could. However, I know that my attempt on hiding and 
showing the text input field and the buttons was not so good taking into account on this principle. However, I have not prioritized this issue this time, because 
the part with the repeating is not a big part of the assignment. I do not need it for the assignment, however I wanted to make it possible to push the + botton and the pen botton without making a whole mess with which botton is visible or not. This could be a problem if the user changes his mind and do not use the cancel botton. I got this problem because I use the same input field, cancel botton and reset botton to both add new element and edit elements, but I am using to different bottons to actualy edit the item or add it to the list. I know my solution on this problem is quite repeating. I tried to fix it, however, I do not want to have a code I have copied from the internet that I do not understand. Therefore, this time, I have chosen to have some repeating code in one minior part of the assignment instead.
