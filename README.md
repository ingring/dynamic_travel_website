## Comments on assignment 3
I tried to follow the dry principle, don't repeat yourself, as best I could. However, I know that my attempt on hiding and 
showing the text input field and the buttons was not so good taking into account on this principle. However, I have not prioritized this issue this time, because 
the part with the repeating is not a big part of the assignment. I do not need it for the assignment, however I wanted to make it possible to push the + botton and the pen botton without making a whole mess with which botton is visible or not. This could be a problem if the user changes his mind and do not use the cancel botton. I got this problem because I use the same input field, cancel botton and reset botton to both add new element and edit elements, but I am using to different bottons to actualy edit the item or add it to the list. I know my solution on this problem is quite repeating. I tried to fix it, however, I do not want to have a code I have copied from the internet that I do not understand. Therefore, this time, I have chosen to have some repeating code in one minior part of the assignment instead.
